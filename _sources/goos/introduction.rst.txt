Introduction
============

Goos is the second version of SPINS that offers more features with a simpler
user interface, including:

- Integration with FDTD solvers
- Optimization with multiple design regions simulataneously

We encourage you to try and use Goos and provide us feedback. Goos development
is still in its early phases so the interface is expected to change quickly.
Documentation is still in progress as well. Unfortunately, Goos is not fully
compatible with the former Invdes library, but it should not take much effort
to migrate to Goos.
