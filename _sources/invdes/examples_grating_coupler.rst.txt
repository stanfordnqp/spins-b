Example: Grating Coupler Optimization
=====================================


Quick start guide
-----------------

Running grating optimization
****************************

To run the example grating coupler optimization, execute the following:


.. code-block:: python

    python3 grating.py run save-folder-name

The example provided has the following parameters

**Material stack parameters**:

* Oxide cladding
* 220 nm silicon
* 2 um buried-oxide (BOX) layer
* Silicon substrate

**Grating parameters**:

* Grating length = 12 um
* Partial etch depth = 0.5 (1 would be fully etched)

**Source parameters**:

* 1550 nm
* 10.4 um mode-field-diameter
* 10 degrees angle of incidence

**Simulation/optimization parameters**:

* Grid discretization = 40 nm
* Number of PML layers = 10
* Minimum feature size = 100 nm
* 60 iterations of continuous optimization
* 200 iterations of discrete optimization

View results
************

To generate the results, run the following:

.. code-block:: python

    python3 grating.py view save-folder-name

To get text-only output , run :code:`view_quick` instead:

.. code-block:: python

    python3 grating.py view_quick save-folder-name


Generate GDS
************

A GDS file (named :code:`grating.gds`) is automatically generated in the :code:`save-folder-name` at the end of an optimization.

We generate a 2d design by extruding the 1D optimized grating coupler design. In the example file the extrude length is 12 um. To generate this GDS we run:

.. code-block:: python

    python3 grating.py gen_gds save-folder-name

Resume optimization
*******************

If for some reason an optimization is terminated, it can be resumed by running:

.. code-block:: python

    python3 grating.py resume save-folder-name

Modifying grating coupler parameters
------------------------------------

For the sake of an example, let's adjust the optimization for a 60% partial etch grating coupler in 300 nm thick silicon nitride on 3um of buried oxide layer with air-cladding. We'll also adjust the source to be a normally incident at 1300 nm.

Material stack
**************
In the :code:`run_opt` function we find parameters for waveguide thickness (:code:`wg_thickness`), thickness of buried-oxide layer (:code:`box_thickness`), and partial etch fraction (:code:`etch_frac`), which we can adjust for our silicon nitride example.

.. code-block:: python

    wg_thickness = 300

    sim_space = create_sim_space(
        "sim_fg.gds",
        "sim_bg.gds",
        grating_len=grating_len,
        box_thickness=3000,
        wg_thickness=wg_thickness,
        etch_frac=0.6,
        wg_width=wg_width)

Next, to adjust the material properties of the stack we look in the :code:`create_sim_space` function and find where the stack variable is defined.

The substrate and buried oxide layer are first set:

.. code-block:: python

    stack = [
        optplan.GdsMaterialStackLayer(
            foreground=optplan.Material(mat_name="Si"),
            background=optplan.Material(mat_name="Si"),
            # Note that layer number here does not actually matter because
            # the foreground and background are the same material.
            gds_layer=[300, 0],
            extents=[-10000, -box_thickness],
        ),
        optplan.GdsMaterialStackLayer(
            foreground=optplan.Material(mat_name="SiO2"),
            background=optplan.Material(mat_name="SiO2"),
            gds_layer=[300, 0],
            extents=[-box_thickness, 0],
        ),
    ]

and so adjusting the :code:`box_thickness` earlier is the only change we need to make. As for the grating coupler, we look at the elements appended to this stack array below. Pre-defined materials in Spins-B are :code:`"Air"`, :code:`"SiO2"`, :code:`"Si"`, :code:`"Si3N4"`. For greatest generality, we'll define a custom material for the silicon nitride in this example where we set the real part of the index to be 2.0 and the imaginary (loss) to be 0.0.

.. note::

    In addition to specifying a single refractive index value, a custom material can be added as well which interpolates dispersion from provided data. Reference :code:`optplan.Material` for more information.

.. code-block:: python

    # If `etch-frac` is 1, then we do not need two separate layers.
    if etch_frac != 1:
        stack.append(
            optplan.GdsMaterialStackLayer(
                foreground=optplan.Material(index=optplan.ComplexNumber(real=2.0,imag=0.0))
                background=optplan.Material(mat_name="Air"),
                gds_layer=[LAYER_SILICON_NONETCHED, 0],
                extents=[0, wg_thickness * (1 - etch_frac)],
            ))
    stack.append(
        optplan.GdsMaterialStackLayer(
            foreground=optplan.Material(index=optplan.ComplexNumber(real=2.0,imag=0.0))
            background=optplan.Material(mat_name="Air"),
            gds_layer=[LAYER_SILICON_ETCHED, 0],
            extents=[wg_thickness * (1 - etch_frac), wg_thickness],
        ))

In addition, we change the background material to be :code:`"Air"` as our grating is air-cladded.

.. code-block:: python

    mat_stack = optplan.GdsMaterialStack(
        # Any region of the simulation that is not specified is filled with
        # oxide.
        background=optplan.Material(mat_name="Air"),
        stack=stack,
    )

.. note::

    You can set the :code:`visualize` flag in the :code:`create_sim_space` function to :code:`True` to visualize the material stack to ensure it has been built correctly.


Grating parameters
******************

We set the partial etch depth earlier, but to re-iterate, we can adjust this value in the :code:`run_opt` function in the arguments to the :code:`create_sim_space` call:

.. code-block:: python

    sim_space = create_sim_space(
            "sim_fg.gds",
            "sim_bg.gds",
            grating_len=grating_len,
            box_thickness=3000,
            wg_thickness=wg_thickness,
            etch_frac=0.6,
            wg_width=wg_width)

We see reference to :code:`grating_len` here, and accordingly this variable can be adjusted as well. This is set at the bottom of the example file in the :code:`__main__` function call:

.. code-block:: python

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import argparse

        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument(
            "action",
            choices=("run", "view", "view_quick", "resume", "gen_gds"),
            help="Must be either \"run\" to run an optimization, \"view\" to "
            "view the results, \"resume\" to resume an optimization, or "
            "\"gen_gds\" to generate the grating GDS file.")
        parser.add_argument(
            "save_folder", help="Folder containing optimization logs.")

        grating_len = 12000
        wg_width = 12000


Source parameters
*****************

Source details are defined in the function :code:`create_objective`

In this function, wavelength is set by simply adjusting the :code:`wlen` variable in the :code:`create_objective` function.

.. code-block:: python

    wlen = 1300


.. note::

    Another location where wavelength is referenced is for plotting the permitvitty for visualization. If desired, adjust the wavelength argument in the :code:`create_sim_space` function at the bottom:

    .. code-block:: python

        if visualize:
            # To visualize permittivity distribution, we actually have to
            # construct the simulation space object.
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            from spins.invdes.problem_graph.simspace import get_fg_and_bg

            context = workspace.Workspace()
            eps_fg, eps_bg = get_fg_and_bg(context.get_object(simspace), wlen=1550)


and then geometric properties of the beam are set by modifying the :code:`GaussianSource` argument in the sim object:

.. code-block:: python

    sim = optplan.FdfdSimulation(
        source=optplan.GaussianSource(
            polarization_angle=0,
            theta=np.deg2rad(0),
            psi=np.pi / 2,
            center=[0, 0, wg_thickness + 700],
            extents=[14000, 14000, 0],
            normal=[0, 0, -1],
            power=1,
            w0=5200,
            normalize_by_sim=True,
        ),
        solver="local_direct",
        wavelength=wlen,
        simulation_space=sim_space,
        epsilon=epsilon,
    )

For this modification, the only change we want is normal incidence (:code:`theta = np.deg2rad(0)`). However, here we can also change the beam-width by adjusting the w0 parameter. Note,:code:` w0` is separate from :code:`extents`, where the former is the beam radius and the latter is the extent over which the source is defined.

.. note::

    The code supports arbitrary rotation of the source. With :code:`psi = np.pi/2` and :code:`polarization_angle = 0`, the polarization is set to be parallel to the grating lines and :code:`theta` controls the angle of incidence.

        :alt: Grating coupler source rotation

Optimization parameters
***********************

Optimization parameters are set in the :code:`create_transformation` function with the following behavior:

.. code-block:: python

    def create_transformations(
            obj: optplan.Function,
            monitors: List[optplan.Monitor],
            cont_iters: int,
            disc_iters: int,
            sim_space: optplan.SimulationSpaceBase,
            min_feature: float = 100,
            cont_to_disc_factor: float = 1.1,
    ) -> List[optplan.Transformation]:

Accordingly, to change the number of continuous or discrete optimzation iterations we adjust this argument where this function is called in the run_opt function:

.. code-block:: python

    trans_list = create_transformations(
        obj, monitors, cont_iters=60, disc_iters=200, sim_space, min_feature=100)

Likewise, the minimum feature size in the optimization is set here as well.

note::

    Spins-B utilizes continuous relaxation in optimization. This means that there is a first stage of optimization where the device permittivity is allowed to vary continuously between the material/cladding value. This final result of this stage acts as a seed for the discrete optimization. In this second stage, a fabricable design is produced. In our experience, 100 iterations for each stage is sufficient to reach a local minima.

Additional information
----------------------

Generating GDS
**************

Once an optimization has completed in the discretization stage, a GDS file can be generated by running:

.. code-block:: python

    python3 grating.py gen_gds save-folder-name

The 1D optimized design is simply extruded to provide a 2D design. The extrude length is determined by the :code:`wg_width` variable set in the :code:`__main__` function:

.. code-block:: python

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import argparse

        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument(
            "action",
            choices=("run", "view", "view_quick", "resume", "gen_gds"),
            help="Must be either \"run\" to run an optimization, \"view\" to "
            "view the results, \"resume\" to resume an optimization, or "
            "\"gen_gds\" to generate the grating GDS file.")
        parser.add_argument(
            "save_folder", help="Folder containing optimization logs.")

        grating_len = 12000
        wg_width = 12000


Minimizing back reflections
***************************

Minimizing back reflections is set by simply turning on the flag at the beginning of the example file:

.. code-block:: python

    # If `True`, also minimize the back-reflection.
    MINIMIZE_BACKREFLECTION = True

Setting this flag to :code:`True` activates:

.. code-block:: python

    refl_sim = optplan.FdfdSimulation(
        source=optplan.WaveguideModeSource(
            center=wg_overlap.center,
            extents=wg_overlap.extents,
            mode_num=0,
            normal=[1, 0, 0],
            power=1.0,
        ),
        solver="local_direct",
        wavelength=wlen,
        simulation_space=sim_space,
        epsilon=epsilon,
    )
    refl_power = optplan.abs(
        optplan.Overlap(simulation=refl_sim, overlap=wg_overlap))**2
    monitor_list.append(
        optplan.SimpleMonitor(name="mon_refl_power", function=refl_power))

    # We now have two sub-objectives: Maximize transmission and minimize
    # back-reflection, so we must an objective that defines the appropriate
    # tradeoff between transmission and back-reflection. Here, we choose the
    # simplest objective to do this, but you can use Spins-B functions to
    # design more elaborate objectives.
    obj = (1 - power) + 4 * refl_power

We see that we create an additional simulation object which performs the simulation for :code:`WaveguideModeSource` instead of the :code:`GaussianSource` from before. We then add the overlap monitor for the reflected power, :code:`refl_power` with the :code:`power` monitor for transmission to form the complete objective function, :code:`obj`.

.. note::
    The coefficient on :code:`4 * refl_power` is a value that we found worked for our test example; however this is a meta-parameter that must be set for specific problems. Setting the value to :code:`4` may be a good starting point, and tweaked based on desired performance.
