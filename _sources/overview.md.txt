# Overview

SPINS is a large nanophotonic optimization library with several
different structures. Here we provide a brief overview of the
sublibraries in SPINS:

- `invdes`: This is the initially-released library that handles the
  inverse design aspect of SPINS.
- `goos`: This is the next generation inverse design library meant
  to replace the older invdes library. This library is
  still under development, though you can run many optimizations
  already with [goos]{.title-ref}.
- `goos_sim`: This module contains simulators for goos.
- [fdfd_tools]{.title-ref} and \`fdfd_solvers\`: This sublibraries
  handle setup and running finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD)
  simulations.
- `gridlock`: This library handles drawing on the Yee grid. The Yee
  grid is a set of offset grids that are used in FDTD and FDFD
  simulations.

There are a few other small sub-libraries under the [spins]{.title-ref}
package that perform tasks specific for the [invdes]{.title-ref}
library, which we will ignore here.
