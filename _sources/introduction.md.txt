# Introduction

SPINS-B is the open source version of
[SPINS](http://techfinder.stanford.edu/technologies/S18-012_inverse-design-software-for),
a framework for gradient-based (adjoint) photonic optimization developed
over the past decade at Jelena Vuckovic\'s [Nanoscale and Quantum
Photonics Lab](http://nqp.stanford.edu) at Stanford University. For
commercial use, the full version can be licensed through the [Stanford
Office of Technology and
Licensing](http://techfinder.stanford.edu/technologies/S18-012_inverse-design-software-for)
(see FAQ).

The overall architecture is explained in our paper [Nanophotonic Inverse
Design with SPINS: Software Architecture and Practical
Considerations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04829).

## Features

-   Gradient-based (adjoint) optimization of photonic devices
-   2D and 3D device optimization using finite-difference
    frequency-domain (FDFD)
-   Support for custom objective functions, sources, and optimization
    methods
-   Automatically save design methodology and all hyperparameters used
    in optimization for reproducibility

## Upcoming Features

We are protoyping the next version of SPINS, known as
`goos/index`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}. This version of SPINS will
support these new features:

-   Integration with FDTD solvers
-   Co-optimization of multiple device regions simulataneously
-   Easier to use and extend

## Overview

Traditional nanophotonic design typically relies on parameter sweeps,
which are expensive both in terms of computation power and time, and
restrictive in their parameter space. Likewise, completely blackbox
optimization algorithms, such as particle swarm and genetic algorithms,
are also highly inefficient. In both these cases, the computational
costs limit the degrees of the freedom of the design to be quite small.
In contrast, by leveraging gradient-based optimization methods, our
nanophotonic inverse design algorithms can efficiently optimize
structures with tens of thousands of degrees of freedom. This enables
the algorithms to explore a much larger space of structures and
therefore design devices with higher efficiencies, smaller footprint,
and novel functionalities.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.5+
-   Some version of BLAS (e.g. OpenBLAS, ATLAS, Intel MKL)
-   [Maxwell solver](http://github.com/stanfordnqp/maxwell-b) for 3D
    simulations

## Recommendations

-   We recommend using [virtual
    environments](https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/venv.html) to
    isolate installation from the rest of the system.
-   If using OpenBLAS, we recommend setting the number of OpenBLAS
    threads (`OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` flag) to 1 as SPINS-B leverages
    parallelism itself.

## Installation

You can install from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/spins/)

```
pip install spins
```

Or you can install the development version if you plan to contribute

```
git clone https://github.com/stanfordnqp/spins-b.git
cd spins-b
make install
```


## Getting Started

See the grating coupler optimization example and the wavelength
demultiplexer example in the `examples` folder. The grating coupler
example covers setting up, running, and resuming a 2D optimization. The
wavelength demultiplexer example covers setting up and running a 3D
optimization as well as various ways of processing the optimization
logs.

More documentation is forthcoming.

## General Concepts

-   **Optimization plan**: The optimization plan defines all the
    photonic optimization problem (i.e. simulation region and desired
    objective) as well as the sequence of optimization steps to achieve
    that objective. You define an optimization plan which is then
    executed by SPINS-B. Doing so enables you to have an exact record of
    all the parameters used to design a device as well as the ability to
    resume optimization if the optimization fails midway.
-   **Simulation space**: The simulation space defines the simulation
    region as well as the design region (see below).
-   **Design area and design region**: The design region is the region
    of the permittivity distribution that is allowed to vary during the
    optimization. The design region is defined as the difference between
    two permittivity distributions: Where the difference is non-zero
    corresponds to the design region. Since most photonic devices are
    fabricated using top-down lithography, SPINS-B by default (this can
    be changed) assumes that the permittivity distribution along the
    z-axis is the same, and hence we speak of a *design area*.
-   **Parametrization**: The parametrization defines how to describe the
    permittivity of the design area. The simplest parametrization is to
    simply describe the value of each pixel on the Yee grid.
-   **Monitors**: Monitors are used to log data during the optimization
    process. *Simple monitors* simply record the value of a function
    whereas *field monitors* post-processes vector field data and can
    select out a particular plane to save data.
-   **Transformation**: Optimization in SPINS-B actually consists of a
    sequence of optimization problems. Each optimization is described by
    a *transformation* (because they transform the parametrization from
    one to another).

## FAQ

### What\'s different between SPINS-B and SPINS?

SPINS is a fully-featured optimization design suite available for
commercial use. It is a superset of SPINS-B and includes the ability to
design devices without writing any code with user-friendly interfaces
and to apply precise fabrication constraints (minimum gap and curvature
constraints). All devices shown in our published work rely on
capabilities found in the fully-featured SPINS.

### How are structures simulated?

SPINS-B uses the finite difference frequency domain (FDFD) simulation
method. This choice was made because in many photonic device designs, we
are concerned with device operation in a small bandwidth at particular
frequencies. The FDFD method is often faster than the more widely used
finite difference time domain (FDTD) method in these cases.

SPINS-B can use both a CPU-based solver or the GPU-accelerated Maxwell
FDFD solver. For 2D simulations, we recommend using a direct matrix
CPU-based solver (\"local_direct\") because it is faster. 3D simulations
require too much memory and an iterative solver must be used. We
recommend the GPU-accelerated MaxwellFDFD solver (\"maxwell_cg\") in
this case.
