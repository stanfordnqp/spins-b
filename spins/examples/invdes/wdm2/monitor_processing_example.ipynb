    "This notebook gives examples for processing spins monitor data.\n",

    "Logging data is stored in _monitors_ that are defined within the optimization plan. Every iteration of the optimization saves a log file in the form a Pickle file, which contains the values of all the monitors at that point in time. To help process this data, `spins` includes the `log_tools` (`spins.invdes.problem_graph.log_tools`).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 general ways that these logs can be processed:\n",
    "1. Defining a `monitor_spec` file that describes how you want data to be plotted.\n",
    "2. Use lower-level `log_tools` functions to load the data and plot the data.\n",
    "3. Directly load and process the Pickle files."

    "A monitor specification file is a YAML file that lists all the monitors to be plotted as well as how they should be plotted (e.g. taking magnitude, real part, etc.). The monitor specification file also allows you to join multiple monitors into one plot (e.g. for joining different monitors across different transformations).\n",
